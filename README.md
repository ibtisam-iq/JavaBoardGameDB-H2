# BoardGameDB-JavaApp

## Description

**Board Game Database Full-Stack Web Application.**
This web application displays lists of board games and their reviews. While anyone can view the board game lists and reviews, users are required to log in to add or edit board games and their reviews. The application supports different roles with varying levels of permissions:
- **Non-members**: Can view board game lists and reviews.
- **Users**: Can add board games and write reviews.
- **Managers**: Can edit and delete reviews, in addition to the permissions of users.
